- An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customised instruction or feedback to learners, usually without requiring intervention from a human teacher. 	 	
- Typically the “intelligent” in Intelligent Tutoring Systems refers to:
  - A problem solving system that can assist and help to produce feedback and hints to learners;
  - Model tracing that predicts the learner’s current mastery and likely next step in order to scaﬀold problem solving;
  - Knowledge tracing that assesses the learner’s abilities and concept-mastery in order to release new exercises or topics to learn; and finally,
  - Tutorial dialogues for scaﬀolding problem solving.

After this, if the student is not able to move ahead on the problem, they can ask for help, and a pop-up will appear on screen for them. After choosing the correct hint, some lower steps that take them towards the solution will appear on screen for them to move ahead on the problem.
